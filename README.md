# Clear-Links
This is a user experience improvement extension that shows web links' destination in a more user friendly and customisable tooltip, simply by moving your mouse over a link; by default it highlights a URL's domain and thus enables more transparent links, improving explicit awareness of your navigation to external website. One potential use case for Clear Links is to make you more easily aware of phishing email scams by allowing you to inspect a link's destination domain and allowing you to determine if the destination is as expected, therefore identifying malicious links.

It is important to note that this extension does not identify malicious links for you, instead it informs you of links to external sites so you can make the decision yourself. By default, links to pages within the same website/hostname do not have a tooltip appear. This can be changed in the Options menu.

This will make a fine addition to your security and privacy digital toolbelt.

Several features and further customisability will be added in the future.
